Based on the popular TV show Loki, you play as a TVA agent expunging all variants that have gone rampant throughout the city. This game is an endless roguelike and will test your skills at a top-down shooter. To traverse the world and take down special variants you will solve mini puzzles by traversing the past and future and use your ability to freeze time to gain the upper hand against these variants. Will you become the true keeper of time?
